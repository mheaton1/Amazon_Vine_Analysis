# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis 
###### The purpose of this analysis is to extract the reviews for products that were included in a program through Amazon Vine. The main task was to determine if there was any biased in the reviews that Sellpay paid Amazon to provide to their members. In this particular analysis we will be analyzing the reviews on videos games. 
## Results

## Summary 
###### According to the data provided it does seem to be a biased. The percentage of 5 star reviews under the Vine program are much greater than Non-Vine program reviews. Over half of the reviews in the Vine program were 5 stars. However, there are a few factors that I would like to further explore. There was a coloumn provided that showed weather or not the item was purchased or not. If the product was given to an individual for free in exchange for a review I do believe that could lead to some bias.
